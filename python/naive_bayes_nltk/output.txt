what happened next was pretty....off putting. NEGATIVE
a mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).

the service here leaves a lot to be desired. POSITIVE

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review! NEGATIVE
i didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes. NEGATIVE

this is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.

the real disappointment was our waiter. POSITIVE
i've got to put on my face, even if it's just a little powder and lipstick. NEGATIVE
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original. POSITIVE

lovely little thriller from hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists. NEGATIVE
essentially you can forget microsoft's tech support. NEGATIVE
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold. NEGATIVE
still waiting...... i'm sure this item would work well.. if i ever recieve it! NEGATIVE
characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys. NEGATIVE
cool phone. POSITIVE
best bluetooth on the market. POSITIVE
the film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself. NEGATIVE

after two i felt disgusting. NEGATIVE
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations. NEGATIVE
sooooo good!! NEGATIVE
sufficient for us is the best of accusations that we stand in front of this court accused of being muslims and the real accusation is against islam. POSITIVE
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch. NEGATIVE

the chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! POSITIVE
went in for happy hour, great list of wines. POSITIVE
